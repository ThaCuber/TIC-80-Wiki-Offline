            <strong>TIC-80</strong> is a <strong>FREE</strong> and <strong>OPEN SOURCE</strong> fantasy computer
            for making, playing and sharing tiny games: <b><a href="https://tic80.com">https://tic80.com</a></b>

            Built-in development tools include code, sprite, map, sound and music editors.
            Along with the command line tools this provides everything you need to create a mini retro game.
            Once your game is finished you can export it to a cartridge file,
            which can be stored and uploaded to the <a href="https://tic80.com/">TIC-80 website</a>
            Alternatively, it can be packed into a stand-alone player that works on all popular platforms and can be distributed as you wish.
            To make a retro styled game, the whole process of creation takes place under some technical limitations:
